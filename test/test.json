    "tgt": "I hope that as you read this story about the Pharaohs, your recollection of the Book of Exodus is not as dim as mine was. Mr. CHRISTOPHER CULLEY, known for his lively and cinematic story \"Naomi of the Mountains,\" has now outdone himself with \"Lily of the Alley\" (CASSELL). Despite its unfortunate title, this work is a great achievement in its own right, showcasing the author's significant growth in his craft. Once again, the story takes place in the Wild West, on the Mexican border. It delves into the mistreatment of American citizens by Villa and the puzzling reluctance of Washington to defend their honor and flag.",
