    "src": "O, did you, sir?' said Mrs. Bywank, with a quick look. 'She told me she meant to go,--but\\nher mind comes about wonderfully sudden sometimes. Here is breakfast, Mr. Rollo. Will you take\\nyour old seat?'\\n\\n'I think it will always come about in the right place at last,' said Rollo, as he complied\\nwith the invitation. The old housekeeper drew a sigh, looking up at the little picture.\\n\\n'My pretty one!' she said. Then applied herself to filling Mr. Rollo's cup. 'Yes, sir, you're\\nright,' she went on after a pause. 'And she never would stop in a wrong one, not a minute,\\nbut for just a few things.'\\n\\n'Mrs. Bywank,' said the young man, 'those few things are all around her.'\\n\\n'You'd think so if you could hear the serenades I hear,' said the housekeeper, 'and see the\\nflowers--and hear the compliments. She tells them to me sometimes, making fun. But the trouble\\nis with Miss Wych, she never will see the world with any eyes but her own,--and who's to make her?'\\n\\nA problem which Rollo considered in silence, and probably swallowed instead of his coffee.\\n\\n'Does she speak freely to you of her impressions, and of what she is doing or going to do?'\\n\\n'Free as a child, Mr. Rollo! Always tells me what dress she'll wear--and then afterwards how\\npeople liked it. And what she does, and what they want her to do. And why her head is not turned,'\\nsaid Mrs. Bywank, in conclusion, 'puzzles _my_ head, I'm sure. Mere handling so many hearts\\nmight do it.'\\n\\nMr. Rollo pursued his breakfast rather thoughtfully and nonchalantly for a time.\\n\\n'Mrs. Bywank, Mrs. Coles is returned.'\\n\\n'Surely!' said Mrs. Bywank, with a slight start. 'Then she'll make mischief,--or it'll be the\\nfirst chance she ever missed.'\\n\\n'And--the world around her is not so simple as your young lady believes.'\\n\\n'No, no!' said Mrs. Bywank, earnestly. 'Well I know that! But just there comes in another trouble\\nI spoke of,--you can't make her believe it, sir,--and so I'm not sure it's always wise to try.'\\nShe paused, in a sort of hesitating way; glancing from her teaspoon to her guest.\\n\\n'It's not wise to try at all,' said he, smiling--a sort of warm genial smile, which went over\\nthe table to his old friend. 'At the same time,'--and his face grew sternly grave,--'it may\\nbe desirable to have some other wisdom come in to her help. I wish,--if you are in any doubt\\nor perplexity about anything you hear, and it may be only a little thing that may give you\\nthe impression,--I wish you would call me in.'\\n\\n'Well sir,--that just touches my thought,' said Mrs. Bywank. 'Or my thought that. For I couldn't\\ndo it, Mr. Rollo, unless,'--and an unmistakeable look of anxious inquiry came across the table.\\n'Unless, you know, sir,' she went on, looking away again,--'unless--excuse my freedom--the\\nconditions of the will are to be carried out.' And the old housekeeper called for hot waffles,\\nand otherwise apologized for touching the subject, by quitting it at once. As soon as all this\\nbustle was disposed of, her guest met her eye again with a frank, bright smile.\\n\\n'The conditions of the will are to be carried out, my friend.'\\n\\nMrs. Bywank brought her hands together with a sense of relief and gladness that somehow went\\nto her eyes too, and she was silent a little.\\n\\n'I did hope it, sir!--And I would far rather apply to you than to Mr. Falkirk. _He_ frets me\\nsometimes,' added the old housekeeper: 'I may say that to you, sir. Now, she's been wild to\\nride all summer,--and a dozen wild to have her; and Mr. Falkirk has never let her go once.\\nAnd so long as he _does_ let her go and dance with the same people, I don't for my part see why.'\\n\\n'Perhaps he does,' said Rollo, rather dryly. 'But I have made the requisite declarations in\\npresence of Mr. Falkirk and Dr. Maryland, and am legally qualified to act, Mrs. Bywank. _She_\\ndoes not know anything of this; and it is not best she should-- for the present.'\\n\\n'No sir--by no means,' said Mrs. Bywank, earnestly. 'For if there is anything miss Wych does\\nhate, it is to have a gentleman speak to her about her doings. When that happens she thinks\\nshe's supposed to have done something dreadful; and it hurts her more than you would guess,\\nsir. Little child as she was then, she would cry her eyes out over a word from Mr. Kennedy,\\nbut her mother might say anything. And it has always been just so with Mr. Falkirk. Only Miss\\nWych never cries for _him_. At least nobody ever sees her.'\\n\\nNow, instead of Mr. Rollo's being alarmed at this, as another man might, it was answered by\\na certain humourous play of face; a slight significance of lip and air, quite difficult to\\ncharacterize. It was not arrogant, nor arbitrary; I do not know how to call it masterful; and\\nyet certainly it expressed no dismay and no apprehension. Perhaps it expressed that he intended\\nto be in a different category from other men. Perhaps he thought Mrs. Bywank meant to read\\nhim a cautionary lesson.\\n\\n'She is in rather a hard position,' he said, gravely. 'I am glad she has got a good friend\\nin you, Mrs. Bywank. And I am glad _I_ have, too.'\\n\\n'Yes, it is hard,' said the old housekeeper, with a glance at him; 'though it is not to be\\nexpected, sir, that you should quite understand it. But Miss Wych is the lovingest little creature\\nthat ever lived, I believe, and as true as the sky. Why, she could cheat Mr. Falkirk day in\\nand day out if she chose!--but if ever those young men _should_ get her to ride, against his\\norders, she would go and tell him of it, the first minute after she got home.'\\n\\nRollo did not ask whether they could do this, or had done it. He went on quietly with his breakfast,\\nonly glancing up at Mrs. Bywank to let her see that he was attending to her.\\n\\n'So that's a great safeguard,' she began again, with a sigh. 'But I wish Mrs. Coles was back\\nin Chicago! Miss Fisher was bad enough. And what the two will do between them--'\\n\\n'What does Miss Fisher do?'\\n\\n'It is plain to me,' said Mrs. Bywank, 'that she wants to pull my young lady down to her way\\nof dress and behaviour; though Miss Wych don't guess it a bit. _That_ she can never do, of\\ncourse. But it is just like Miss Fisher to push where she can't pull. Do you understand me, sir?'\\n\\n'Quite.'\\n\\n'So that makes me anxious, sir. And there are hands enough to help.'\\n\\nLeaning somewhat towards her young guest, breakfast rather forgotten on both sides, so they\\nsat; when the door opened softly and Wych Hazel came in. But if the first minute inside the\\ndoor could have been instantly exchanged for the last one outside, it is probable that the\\nyoung lady of Chickaree would have disturbed no cabinet council over her that day. For with\\nthe first sight of the very people she expected to find, there rushed over her a horrible fear\\nthat Mr. Rollo would think she had come to see _him!_--and that Mrs. Bywank would think so--and\\n(worst of all) that she thought so herself! But there was no retreating now. So passing swiftly\\nto the old housekeeper's chair, and laying both hands on her shoulders to keep her in it, Hazel\\nstooped down to kiss her; and then straightening herself up like a young arrow, she gave from\\nbehind Mrs. Bywank a demure good-morning to Mr. Rollo.\\n\\nThat gentleman had not been so much engrossed with the conversation as to have at all the air\\nof being 'surprised,' or he was too good a man of the world to shew it. He had sprung up instantly\\nas Wych Hazel came in, and now he came round to where she stood to shake hands, looking very\\nbright, but as if her appearance was the simplest thing in the world.\\n\\n'You have not had breakfast?' he said.\\n\\n'I have had the opportunity. But you look altogether too comfortable here, you and Mrs. Bywank!--As\\nfor me, I have been breakfasting with two bears, and had nearly forgotten how civilization acts.'\\n\\n'My dear!' said Mrs. Bywank.--'Not \\\"breakfasting\\\"--when you were coming here, Miss Wych?'\\n\\n'Not much, Byo, to say the truth. I gave Mr. Falkirk _his_ coffee--hot and hot.'\\n\\n'He didn't give you waffles,' said Rollo, making room for her plate and cup upon the table.\\n'Mrs. Bywank, we must take care of her. I shall never grumble at sending answers to invitations\\nafter this.'\\n\\nHe was rendering little services and making himself variously useful, with the air of a person\\nmore at home than she was: drawing down a blind to keep the sun from her face, and opening\\nanother window to let in the air and the view.\\n\\n'Take care of me!' said Wych Hazel, with a look at the table instead of at him, and then beginning\\nto touch and mend things generally to suit her fancy. 'It is very plain what _I_ have to do!\\nThere is the jar of marmalade quite pushed out of reach. And if you do not empty it, Mr. Rollo,\\nMrs. Bywank will think you have not fulfilled the sweet promise of your earlier years.'\\n\\n'My dear!' remonstrated Mrs. Bywank, uneasily.\\n\\n'I have satisfied her,' said Rollo, dryly. 'But there is a little left for you. There wouldn't\\nhave been if the two bears had known where it was.'\\n\\n'Mr. Falkirk was fearfully growly this morning,' said Wych Hazel. 'And every time he growled\\nGotham grumbled. So I had a fusillade. Where is your fruit, Byo?'\\n\\n'There was none brought in yesterday, Miss Wych, I'm sorry to say.'\\n\\n'None at all in the house?'\\n\\n'There's a basket in your room, my dear; but of course'--\\n\\n'Not \\\"of course\\\" at all,' said the girl, jumping up to go for it. 'You know that is a sort\\nof fruit I never eat.'\\n\\nWhich might have left it doubtful what sort she _did_ eat,--the basket contained so many, in\\nsuch splendid variety. Hazel sat down in her place and began to pile up the beauties in a majolica\\ndish.\\n\\n'Aren't you going to give me some?' said Rollo, looking on.\\n\\nThe answer tarried while Hazel's little fingers dived down after peaches and plums of extra\\nsize with which to crown her dish; but so doing, they suddenly brought up a white note, suspiciously\\nsealed with red wax. The girl dropped it, as if it had been a wasp; and hastily setting the\\nbasket down on the floor, pushed the unfinished dish to a position before Mr. Rollo.\\n\\n'There!' she said, 'will that do?'\\n\\n'Do you mean that you give me all these?'\\n\\n'Every bit.'\\n\\n'Mrs. Bywank, might I make interest with you for a finger- glass?'\\n\\nWhich being supplied, the gentleman proceeded to a leisurely ablution of his fingers, and then\\nlooked at the dish of fruit before him with grave consideration.\\n\\n'Which is the best?' said he.\\n\\n'They all look about alike, to me,' said Wych Hazel, raising her eyebrows. 'I shall be happy\\nto hear, when you have found out.'\\n\\nExercising a great deal of deliberation, Rollo finally chose out a bunch of Frontignac grapes\\nand two Moorpark apricots, and set them before Wych Hazel.\\n\\n'Will you accept these from me?' he said, coolly. 'They are my own property, and are offered\\nto you. Taste and see if they are as good as they ought to be.'\\n\\nShe looked up, and down, laughing.\\n\\n'That is the way you come round people! Will you take the responsibility? Suppose I am asked,\\nsome day, whether they-- were--what they ought to be?'\\n\\n'You can puzzle him just as well after knowing the fact, as before,' Rollo said, with perfect\\ngravity.\\n\\n'Well,' said Hazel, pulling a grape from the bunch. 'Perhaps my misleading powers may be equal\\nto that. This one is quite good--and not at all sour,' she added, with a flash of her eyes--which,\\nhowever, went to Mrs. Bywank. 'What do you want, Dingee?'\\n\\nDingee advanced and laid a card on the table.\\n\\n'Say I am at breakfast. I cannot be expected to keep awake all night and all day too.'\\n\\n'Permit me to inquire,' said Rollo, as he also attacked the grapes, but not looking at them,\\n'whether you did your share of growling this morning? I am sure no one had more cause.'\\n\\n'No,' said the girl, laughing. 'I feel that I have a great reserve in store for somebody. Well,\\nDingee?'\\n\\nA card with a written message this time. Hazel looked at it, drew her brows together, and,\\nseizing a pencil, wrote a vigorous 'No,' across the lines.\\n\\n'For somebody,' Rollo repeated. 'I am not sure that we got hold of the right delinquent. After\\nall, peaches are the best thing after waffles and coffee. Try that.' And he placed a fine one\\nalongside of Wych Hazel's plate.\\n\\n'The thing is,' said Hazel, 'that unless you can growl with authority, nobody marks you.'\\n\\n'General Merrick and Major Seaton, Missee Hazel, ma'am,' said her dark retainer, coming back.\\n\\n'I thought I told you I was at breakfast?' said Hazel, in a tone of displeasure.\\n\\n'Yes'm--but the Major he bound to know 'bout sumfin Missee Hazel left onsartin last night.\\n'Spect he'd like a keep-sake, too,' said Dingee, laying down another card. 'Mas' May put _his_\\naway mighty safe.'\\n\\nIf ever his little mistress was near being furious, I think it was then. Eyes and cheeks were\\nin a flame.\\n\\n'I left nothing uncertain last night!' she said, turning upon him. 'Major Seaton knows that,\\nif he will take the trouble to remember. And Dingee, if you bring me another message--of any\\nsort--before I whistle for you, I will put you out of service for a month. Now go!'\\n\\n'Is that the way you punish unlucky servitors?' said Rollo, looking much amused.\\n\\nShe had come back to her grapes, giving them the closest attention, feeling shy and nervous\\nand disturbed to any point; but now fun got the upper hand. So first she bit her lips, and\\nthen--the laugh must come! Clear and ringing and mirthsome, as if there was never a growl in\\nall the world.\\n\\n'That is one way,' she said.\\n\\n'Sounds peaceable,' said Rollo demurely, though smiling; 'but I don't know! I am afraid it\\nmight prove very severe. What is the appeal from one of your sentences?'\\n\\n'There is none. I am a Mede and a Persian combined. Byo, why don't you give Mr. Rollo some\\ncream with his peaches, and postpone me till another time?'\\n\\n'She'll have to postpone me, too,' said Rollo. 'I must go. Shall I come for you at four o'clock?\\nIt will be too hot, I am afraid, before; and we have a good way to go.'\\n\\nCHAPTER XXIX.\\n\\nJEANNIE DEANS.\\n\\nIt wanted some time of four o'clock yet, when Miss Kennedy came quietly into Mr. Falkirk's\\nstudy and sat down by the window.\\n\\n'Are you at leisure, sir?' she said, intertwining her fingers in a careless sort of way among\\nthe vines that hung there.\\n\\n'My dear, I have been at leisure so long that I wish I could say I was busy. But I am not busy.\\nWhat is it, Miss Hazel?'\\n\\n'Only a few business questions, sir,' she said, attending to the vines. 'Will you let me ride\\nwith Major Seaton on Thursday?'\\n\\n'Would you like to go with him?'\\n\\n'I always like to ride, sir.'\\n\\n'You have not a horse yet, my dear; that is a difficulty. I do not know this Major Seaton's\\nhorses--nor himself.'\\n\\n'Quite reliable, sir--according to him. Will you let me ride with Mr. Rollo this afternoon?'\\n\\n'I suppose there is no good reason to be assigned against that,' said Mr. Falkirk, rather growingly,\\nand after a pause. It sounded a little as if he would have liked it if the fact had been otherwise.\\n\\n'You consider Wednesday a more safe day than Thursday, sir?'\\n\\n'I am not superstitious, Miss Hazel. The only thing I ever was in fear of is enchantment!'\\n\\n'Well sir,--you have doubtless studied the case enough to know which is the more \\\"enchanting\\\"\\nof the two,' said Miss Hazel, daringly. 'Shall I give Mr. May a ride on Friday?'\\n\\n'Will you have a horse on Friday?'\\n\\n'My horse seems to be a slow one, by the time it takes him to come,' said Wych Hazel. 'Will\\nhe be here this afternoon, Mr. Falkirk?'\\n\\n'I suppose Rollo will see to that,' said Mr. Falkirk, beginning to turn about some papers that\\nwere on the table.\\n\\n'Yes, sir,' said his ward, with her small fingers still playing among the vines; 'I suppose\\nhe will. It is rather Mr. Rollo's style. But that makes it slightly awkward for me, Mr. Falkirk.'\\n\\n'In what respect, Miss Hazel?'\\n\\n'Most of these other gentlemen think themselves qualified to \\\"see to\\\" so small a consignment\\nas myself; and not being posted as to your scale of enchantment and danger, may feel it the\\nreverse of a compliment to meet me riding with Mr. Rollo, on his horse.'\\n\\n'Well, my dear, what do you wish me to do in the matter? You are not obliged to go with Rollo,\\nthat I know of. Do you wish to compliment these other small fry?'\\n\\n'I want to ride, Mr. Falkirk, I believe I should go with Mr. Simms--if he were the only chance;\\nand that is saying a good deal. However, I can throw all the responsibility on you, sir; that\\nis one comfort.'\\n\\n'It won't break me,' said Mr. Falkirk; 'that is another. Why do they all come for you so, this\\nhot weather!'\\n\\nBut she laughed at that, and went off out of the room.\\n\\nWhen she came down to the side entrance of Chickaree some hour or two later, she found her\\nside-saddle going on an Arab- looking brown mare, and Rollo playing hostler. His own horse\\nstanding by was clearly also a new comer; a light bay, nervous and fidgety, for he did not\\nkeep still one minute; ears, hoofs, eyes and head were constantly and restlessly shifting.\\nThe brown mare stood still, only lifting her pretty head and looking as Wych Hazel came out.\\nShe ran down the steps.\\n\\n'I got leave!' she said, gleefully,--'did you?'--then stopped, surveying operations. 'But was\\nthere nobody about the place to do that but Mr. Rollo?\\n\\nThe quiet negative which answered this covered more ground than the question. Rollo finished\\nhis work carefully, with one or two looking on; mounted the little lady, and went to his own\\nhorse. Before mounting, here, he seemed to hold some conversation with the creature; caressed\\nhim; stood in front and spoke to him, patting and stroking his head; then in another moment\\nwas on his back.\\n\\nThere is a great difference in people's riding, as there is in people's walking; and once in\\na while, among plenty of good average walkers and riders, there is one whom it is a pleasure\\nto see. This man was such a one. He was a perfectly well-made man, and had the ease and grace\\nin all his movements which such a build goes far to ensure; when on horseback it seemed as\\nif he had communicated these qualities to his horse, and the two moved as one embodiment of\\nease and grace, with power superadded. Stuart Nightingale on horseback was a fine gentleman,\\nperfectly got up, and riding well, but yet a fine gentleman in the saddle. Major Seaton rode\\nruggedly, if I may say so. Mr. May was more at home in his phaeton; others were more or less\\nstiff and uncertain. But the attitude and action of Rollo were utter unconscious ease, whatever\\nform of action his horse might take. So it was now. For a few minutes his restless animal moved\\nin all sorts of eccentric ways; but where most men would have been a little awkward and many\\nvery miserable, his rider was simply unconcerned and seemed to be taking his pleasure. To see\\nsuch a rider is to be filled with a great sense of harmony.\\n\\nWhat a ride they had then, when the hill was descended and the gates of Chickaree left behind!\\nThe road for some miles was known to Wych Hazel; then they branched off into another where\\nall was new. The qualities of the brown mare had been coming to her rider's knowledge by degrees;\\na beautiful mouth, excellent paces, thorough training; knowing her business and doing it. As\\nthey entered upon a long smooth stretch of road without anybody in sight, Rollo proposed a\\nrun; and they had it; and it was upon drawing bridle after this that he asked a question.\\n\\n'How do you like her?'\\n\\nNow Miss Kennedy, in defiance of all-known laws, had never been so smitten with the regulation\\nbeaver upon a man's head, as to place it on her own. So instead of its stiff proportions she\\nwore a little round straw hat; utterly comfortable, utterly graceful, and drooping down over\\nher eyes \\u00e0 la Marie Stuart, so as to keep those wayward things in deep seclusion when she chose.\\nJust now, however, she turned them full on her companion, answering:\\n\\n'O _very_ much!--I suspect she has only one fault.'\\n\\n'What in the world is that? Have you discovered already what I have sought for in vain?\\n\\n'It is the reverse of my speciality,' said Wych Hazel--'so perhaps that makes me sharpsighted.\\nI am afraid she always behaves well.'\\n\\n'She knows her business,' said Rollo. 'I think what you want her to do, she will do. Pardon\\nme; do you wish her--it is rather paradoxical--to _thwart_ you wishes!'\\n\\n'No,' said the girl, laughing a little,--'I put it somewhat differently: perhaps I might like,\\njust occasionally, to thwart hers!'\\n\\n'She'll be an extraordinary animal if she does not some time or other give you a chance. Now\\ndo you know what you are coming to?'\\n\\nThe scenery was changing, had changed. The level, open road they had been clearing on the gallop,\\nhad gradually drawn within high banks, which as they went on grew higher and broken, till the\\ncountry assumed the character of a glen or deep valley. Opening a little here and there, this\\nvalley shewed ahead of them now a succession of high, long, dingy buildings; and a large, rapid\\nstream of water was seen to run under the opposite bank. It had not been visible until now;\\nso it probably turned off near this point into an easier channel than the course of their road\\nwould have afforded. The scene was extremely picturesque; sunshine and shadow mingling on the\\nsides of the dell and on the roofs and gables of the buildings in the bottom. These were both\\nlarge and small; it was quite a settlement; cottages, small and mean and dingy, standing all\\nalong on the higher banks, as well as lower down near the stream. Gradually the dell spread\\ninto a smooth, narrow valley.\\n\\n'The mills, I suppose? I have not been this way before. It makes me half wild to get out again!\\nSo if I do any wild things----How lovely the dell is!'\\n\\n'This is Morton Hollow,' said Rollo, looking at her. 'Can I help you do any wild things?'\\n\\n'The houses are like him,' said Hazel, turning away, and her colour deepening under the look.\\n'Such a place!'\\n\\nShe might say 'such a place.' As they went on the character of it became visible more and more.\\nThere were dark, high, close factories, whence the hum of machinery issued; poor, mean dwellings,\\nsmall and large, clustered here and there in the intermediate spaces, from which if any sounds\\ncame, they were less pleasant than the buzz of machines. Scarce any humanity was abroad; what\\nthere was deepened the impression of the dreariness of the place.\\n\\n'Mr. Rollo,' said Hazel, at last. 'I hope your friend does not live down here?'\",\n            ",
    "tgt": "\"Did she tell you she was going?\" asked Mrs. Bywank, glancing at Mr. Rollo. \"Her mind changes so quickly sometimes. Breakfast is ready, would you like your usual seat?\" As he sat down, Rollo remarked that everything always ends up in the right place eventually.\n\nMrs. Bywank sighed, gazing at a picture on the wall. \"My pretty one,\" she murmured. \"Miss Wych always does what is right, but it's a pity she doesn't see the world from any perspective other than her own.\"\n\nRollo sipped his coffee, thoughtfully. \"Does she talk to you freely about her plans and opinions?\"\n\n\"Absolutely! She tells me about everything she does, what she wears and even repeats the compliments she receives. The only thing that puzzles me is why her head isn't turned - she has so many admirers.\"\n\nRollo continued to eat, reflecting that Miss Wych was not as naive as she believed. \"Mrs. Coles has returned,\" he announced, earning a worried glance from Mrs. Bywank. Rollo cautioned that the world was not as simple as Miss Wych perceived it to be. Mrs. Bywank agreed, but it was not wise to try and change her opinion. Rollo suggested that perhaps someone could offer her wisdom in a way she would accept. He offered to help if Mrs. Bywank ever had any doubts.\n\nRelieved, Mrs. Bywank exclaimed that she had thought Rollo might not be able to help because of the will. He reassured her that he could do what was necessary without revealing anything to Miss Wych.\n\nMrs. Bywank then confided that Miss Wych had been wanting to ride all summer, but Mr. Falkirk would not allow it, much to her frustration. Rollo dryly suggested that Mr. Falkirk had reasons for his actions. Mrs. Bywank praised Rollo for being a good friend to Miss Wych and for offering his assistance. Rollo acknowledged that Miss Wych was in a challenging position but praised her for her loyalty and honesty. Despite her sweet nature, he recognized that she was capable of deceiving Mr. Falkirk. However, he also knew that she would tell him immediately if she ever disobeyed his orders.Without asking if they had done it or not, Rollo continued quietly eating his breakfast while Mrs. Bywank voiced her concerns. She wished Mrs. Coles was back in Chicago as she believed Miss Fisher was attempting to influence Hazel's style and behavior. Despite Mrs. Bywank's worries, Rollo understood the situation. As they chatted, Hazel entered suddenly and was momentarily horrified that Rollo would think she came to see him. However, she managed to compose herself and greeted Mrs. Bywank warmly before greeting Rollo politely. They chatted and ate breakfast, with Rollo playfully teasing Hazel and making himself useful by adjusting the blinds and opening a window. When Hazel started arranging fruit, she found a suspiciously sealed letter and hastily set it aside, giving the fruit to Rollo. After some consideration, Rollo offered Hazel his own grapes and apricots, and she playfully accepted them. The chapter ends with Dingee, presumably a household member, interrupting their conversation.announced Miss Kennedy, with a bright smile, as she approached Rollo and the horses. \"Are these our mounts for the day?\"\n\nRollo nodded, his attention focused on calming his fidgety horse. \"Yes, this one's mine. He's a little high-strung, so be careful.\"\n\nWych Hazel stroked the brown mare's neck. \"She seems nice and calm. What's her name?\"\n\n\"Jeannie Deans,\" replied Rollo. \"She's a reliable old girl. We'll have a good ride, you'll see.\"\n\nMiss Kennedy mounted her horse with ease, the side saddle making it comfortable and familiar for her. Rollo mounted his own horse and they set off on their ride, both enjoying the cool breeze and the beauty of the countryside.\n\nAs they rode, they chatted and laughed, enjoying each other's company. Wych Hazel felt grateful to have such a good friend in Rollo, who always made her feel comfortable and at ease.\n\nWhen they returned to Chickaree, Wych Hazel dismounted from Jeannie Deans and thanked Rollo for the ride. \"That was lovely, thank you. And thank you for taking care of me and letting me ride your horse.\"\n\nRollo grinned. \"Anytime, Hazel. It's always a pleasure to ride with you.\"\n\nAs she walked back into the house, Wych Hazel felt a sense of contentment and happiness. She had enjoyed a wonderful ride with a good friend and felt grateful for the simple pleasures in life.With a gleeful expression, she asked, \"Did you?\" However, upon surveying the area, she asked, \"But was there nobody about the place to do that but Mr Rollo?\" Rollo finished his work, with some onlookers, before he mounted his horse. He conversed with his horse, caressed him, and spoke to him before effortlessly mounting him. Rollo was a pleasure to watch, possessing ease and grace in all his movements, and he and his horse were in perfect harmony. As they rode through the hills and valleys, Wych Hazel admired Rollo's horse and informed him of her liking for the animal. They arrived at Morton Hollow, a dreary and desolate place filled with factories and poor housing. Hazel expressed hope that Rollo's friend did not live in that area.",
